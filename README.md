# Floocraft
Floocraft is a Minecraft Forge mod which adds content themed around Floo Powder, from the Harry Potter franchise:
* Players build fireplaces to teleport to and from, which are connected to the Floo Network using Floo Signs.
* Floo Powder, when thrown into fire, turns it green and allows the user to walk in and teleport, or peek into the fire and see what's on the other side.
* Floo Torches are torches which emit green light and cause random short-range teleportation on contact.
* Floower Pots automatically transform nearby fires if they contain Floo Powder.

## Information for Players and Pack Developers
Floocraft has no world generation.
